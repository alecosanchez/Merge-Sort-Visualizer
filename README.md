# Merge-Sort-Visualizer
This program uses JS, CSS, and React to give a visual representation on how the "merge sort" algorithm goes about organizing 350 columns in order from smallest to greatest. This implementation produces a stable sort, meaning the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. The overall time complexity of Merge sort is O(nLogn). 

Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element.
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the final sorted list.
